# Loan Repayment Prediction
#### This project aims to classify and predict whether borrowers repaid their loans in full using lending data from 2007-2010. The dataset provided has been pre-cleaned, with missing values (NA) removed, making it easier to focus on building and evaluating the predictive model.

## Libraries Used
### pandas
### numpy
### seaborn
### matplotlib
### sklearn

## Dataset
### The dataset is provided as a CSV file. It is recommended to use this CSV as it has been cleaned of NA values.

## Project Steps
### 1. Import Data
#### Load the dataset into your environment using pandas.

### 2. Explore and Visualize Data
#### Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, detect any potential outliers, and visualize relationships between variables using seaborn and matplotlib.

### 3. Preprocess Data
#### Prepare the data for modeling, which includes splitting the data into features and labels, scaling features, and possibly handling categorical variables.

### 4. Build Models
#### Use various machine learning models from sklearn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to classify whether the loan was repaid in full.

### 5. Evaluate Models
#### Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and cross-validation.
